RobotEmulator
=============
Java program to emulate an FRC robot (as of the 2014 FRC season). Lets you control robot components such as SpeedControllers, Solenoids, etc. using Joystick inputs. Also lets you emulate sensors on the robot (cameras excluded for now)

Requires an installation of the JDK, and code to drive an FRC robot. Will not make any changes to code, only compile it.
